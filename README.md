# Analog Clock Project

Welcome to the *Analog Clock* project! This is a simple, responsive analog clock built using *JavaScript, **HTML, and **CSS*. The clock mimics the functionality of a traditional analog clock with an hour, minute, and second hand.

## Features

- *Real-time Clock*: The clock updates in real-time, displaying the current hour, minute, and second based on the user's system time.
- *Responsive Design*: The clock adjusts to different screen sizes, maintaining its shape and proportion across devices.
- *Minimalistic Design*: The clock has a clean and minimal interface with smooth transitions of the clock hands.
- *Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*: No external libraries or frameworks are used, ensuring a lightweight and fast-performing project.

## Project Structure

- index.html: The main HTML file that holds the structure of the clock.
- style.css: The CSS file for styling the clock, including the clock face, hands, and positioning.
- script.js: The JavaScript file that drives the clock's functionality, dynamically updating the time every second.

## How It Works

The clock's functionality is based on JavaScript's Date object, which provides the current time. Each hand (hour, minute, second) is rotated based on the respective time unit.

- *Hour Hand*: Moves based on the current hour and adjusts for minutes.
- *Minute Hand*: Moves based on the current minute and adjusts for seconds.
- *Second Hand*: Updates every second to reflect the current second.

## Getting Started

To use or modify this project:

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone
   
   
2. Open index.html in your browser to view the clock in action.

## Customization

You can easily customize the design and functionality by:

- Modifying the *CSS* for different colors, shapes, and animations.
- Changing the *JavaScript* logic to create additional features, like different time zones or an AM/PM display.
